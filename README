EpiBoy Extension for Epiphany
by Matt Read

This extension will create a new Tomboy note in Tomboy based upon the current
web page and selected text.

USAGE

For this extension to work it nakes a DBus call to Tomboy, which means Tomboy
has to be running to create the new note.

Simply select the text you want in the note and press CTRL+SHIFT+B to create
the note and open it in Tomboy. Or, you can add the tomboy button to your
toolbar where ever you want.

The default notebook is "Snippets". Hopefullythis will be customizable in the
next release.
