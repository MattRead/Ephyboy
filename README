EpiBoy Extension for Epiphany
by Matt Read

This extension will create a new Tomboy note in Tomboy based upon the current
web page and selected text.

USAGE

For this extension to work it nakes a DBus call to Tomboy, which means Tomboy
has to be running to create the new note.

Simply select the text you want in the note and press CTRL+SHIFT+B to create
the note and open it in Tomboy. The default notebook is "Snippets". Hopefully
this will be customizable in the next release.
