EpiBoy Extension for Epiphany by Matt Read, 2010
http://github.com/MattRead/EpiBoy/wiki

This extension will create a new Tomboy note in Tomboy based upon the current
web page and selected text.

INSTALLATION

Just copy `tomboy.js` and `tomboy.ephy-extension` to `~/.gnome2/epiphany/extensions/`.
Then enable the extension in the Extension Manager.

USAGE

For this extension to work it nakes a DBus call to Tomboy, which means Tomboy
has to be running to create the new note.

Simply select the text you want in the note and press CTRL+SHIFT+B to create
the note and open it in Tomboy. Or, you can add the tomboy button to your
toolbar where ever you want.

The default notebook is "Snippets". Hopefully this will be customizable in the
next release.
